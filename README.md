# PicSpotFinder Android App
Android Application that allows users to quickly see the pictures posted to Instagram taken near a user-specified location.

2017 was a year of being in new places for me (http://khalidshakur.com/traveling/ if you're curious). While touring different cities and countries, I often found it hard to decide where I wanted to go and what I wanted to go see. I would search for interesting destinations and then narrow down the results by searching for images of each destination. Thid app is intended to streamline this process.

### Prerequisites
1. Device running running at least Android Lollipop, although I recommend using a device running Nougat, as I have not tested other versions.
2. May have to enable developers' options and USB debugging (https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html).
