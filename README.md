# PicSpotFinder Android App

2017 was a year of being in new places for me ([my travel website](http://khalidshakur.com/traveling/) if you're curious). While touring different cities and countries, I often found it hard to decide where I wanted to go and what I wanted to see. I would search for interesting destinations and then narrow down the results by searching for images of each destination. This app is intended to streamline this process.

##### TL;DR 
Android App that allows users to quickly see the pictures posted to Instagram taken near a user-specified location.

### Prerequisites
1. Device running at least Android Lollipop, although I recommend using a device running Nougat, as I have not tested other versions of Android.
2. May have to enable developers' options and USB debugging (https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html).

### Installing
1. Download the [apk](app-debug.apk) directly to your Android device or your PC.
2. If you downloaded the apk to your PC, transfer the apk to the "Downloads" folder of your Android device. I think the easiest way to do this is to plug your device into your PC via cable. Enable "Transfer files" mode. Move apk as you would move a file to an external drive.
3. Navigate to the apk on your Android device. Ideally it will be located in the "Downloads" folder. Open it, and you should be directed to install the app.

### Planned Work
1. Move away from using the [Instagram REST API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/) as I believe it has been deprecated.
2. Display image metadata, so that users can for example navigate to the exact spot a viewed image was taken to replicate it.
3. Give users the ability to adjust the maximum distance from the specified location images shown can be from.
