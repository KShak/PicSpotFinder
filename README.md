# PicSpotFinder Android App

2017 was a year of being in new places for me (http://khalidshakur.com/traveling/ if you're curious). While touring different cities and countries, I often found it hard to decide where I wanted to go and what I wanted to see. I would search for interesting destinations and then narrow down the results by searching for images of each destination. This app is intended to streamline this process.

##### TL;DR 
Android App that allows users to quickly see the pictures posted to Instagram taken near a user-specified location.

### Prerequisites
1. Device running running at least Android Lollipop, although I recommend using a device running Nougat, as I have not tested other versions.
2. May have to enable developers' options and USB debugging (https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html).

### Installing
1. Download the [apk]() directly to your Android device or your PC.
2. If you downloaded the apk to your PC, transfer the apk to the "Downloads" folder of your Android deivce. I think the easiest way to do this is plug your device into your PC via cable. Enable "Transfer files" mode.
3. Navigate to the apk on your Android device. Ideally it will be located in the "Downloads" folder. Open it, and the directions to install should be fairly straightforward. Enjoy!

### Future Work
